# Restart Marketplace
This was our final project in Restart Network. I worked with <a href="https://github.com/talar90">@talar90</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/adrianabelei">@adrianabelei</a> on this project as a team and we used SCRUM. Restart Network asked us to create their own online marketplace for students. <br> The main feature is voice recognition, so admins can work with voice commands to take or add money. There are different kind of features.

# Technologies:
 Node.js, React.js, Express, Web Speech API, MongoDB, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
